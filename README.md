# P02-Predicting_World_Poverty
## "Predicting Poverty Around the World"

This project was issued as the **Capstone Project** of the **Microsoft Professional Program - Data Science Track**, which took the form of a DrivenData competition. The primary goal of such competition was to predict, for a set of individuals across seven different countries,  the probability of living below a pre-established poverty line threshold, based certain socioeconomic indicators.

The project was developed using Microsoft Azure Machine Learnign Studio. As at the time of writing this "read.me" file such platform does not have any option to export its experiments/projects to Python, the methodology followed for the competition is explained in detail on the "Competition_Report" file attached to this repository. To compliment this document, screen shots of the Azure ML Studio canvas have been added showing the experiment's architecture adopted. The Jupyter Notebook file also attached, contains the python scripts used on the data preprocessing and visualization stages.

**Problem/challenge type:** Regression, Supervised Learning.

**Technologies used:** Python (pandas, numpy. matplotlib, seaborn), JupyterLab, Azure ML Studio, Msft Excel.

**Competition final score:** Ranked 4th place out of 429 competitors.
