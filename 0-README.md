# P02-Predicting_World_Poverty
## "Predicting Poverty Around the World"

This project was issued as the Capstone Project of the Microsoft Professional Program "Data Science Track", which took the form of a DrivenData competition. The primary goal of such competition was to predict the probability that individuals across seven different countries live based on pre-established poverty line threshold and given certain socioeconomic indicators.

The project was developed using Microsoft Azure Machine Learnign Studio. Since at the date of writting this "read me" file, such platform still does not have any option to export its experiments/projects to Python, the methodology followed for the competition is explained in detail on the "Competition_Report" file attached to this repository. To complement this document, screen shots of the Azure ML Studio canvas have been added showing the experiment architecture adopted. The Jupyter Notebook file also attached, contains the python scripts used on the data preprocessing and visualization stages.

Competition final score: Ranked 4th place out of 429 competitors

Problem/challenge type: Regression, Supervised Learning

Technologies used: Python (pandas, numpy. matplotlib, seaborn), JupyterLab, Azure ML Studio, Msft Excel.
